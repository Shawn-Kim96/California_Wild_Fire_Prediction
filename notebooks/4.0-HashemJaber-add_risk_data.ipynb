This process used the following multi-stage approach. First we resampled WHP from 270-m to 30-m by running two low-pass filters at 270-m, then we stamped original values back on top to preserve the spatial patterns in the 270-m data. Next, we used two iterative 150-m moving window means on the 30-m WHP to create the primary smoothed WHP raster, and we also created an alternate version of smoothed WHP using three iterative 510-m moving window means. The final 30-m WHP raster was generated by using the cell values produced with the tighter window where they exist (up to 300-m into nonburnable fuels) and the alternate version everywhere else with non-zero BP (between 300-m and 1530-m into non-burnable fuels).

National wildfire hazard datasets of annual burn probability and fire intensity were generated from the LANDFIRE 2014 data by the USDA Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station (Short et al. 2020) using the large fire simulation system (FSim). These national datasets produced with FSim have a relatively coarse cell size of 270 meters (m). To bring these datasets down to a finer resolution more useful for assessing hazard and risk to communities, we upsampled them to the native 30 m resolution of the LANDFIRE fuel and vegetation data. In this upsampling process, we also spread values of modeled burn probability and intensity into developed areas represented in LANDFIRE fuels data as non-burnable.

            "    Text: This dataset is the Flame Length Exceedance Probability - 8 foot (FLEP8) raster for California. It is part of the Wildfire Risk to Communities: Spatial datasets of landscape-wide wildfire risk components for the United States. The values of FLEP4 represent the probability of having flame lengths greater than 8 feet if a fire occurs. FLEP8 indicates the potential for high wildfire intensity. Because 8 feet is near the limit of mechanical fire control, FLEP8 represents the likelihood that fire intensity will be beyond the ability of heavy machinery, such as bulldozers, to control.\n",

As such, the data presented here reflect landscape conditions as of the end of 2014. National wildfire hazard datasets of annual burn probability and fire intensity were generated from the LANDFIRE 2014 data by the USDA Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station (Short et al. 2020) using the large fire simulation system (FSim). These national datasets produced with FSim have a relatively coarse cell size of 270 meters (m). To bring these datasets down to a finer resolution more useful for assessing hazard and risk to communities, we upsampled them to the native 30 m resolution of the LANDFIRE fuel and vegetation data. In this upsampling process, we also spread values of modeled burn probability and intensity into developed areas represented in LANDFIRE fuels data as non-burnable.

BP was not allowed to spread into open water or snow and ice land covers, but it was allowed into bare ground and agriculture land covers as well as developed urban areas. This method results in BP values that rapidly diminish with increasing distance into nonburnable areas.

This was done by setting zero-BP cells to nodata, then running two low-pass filters over the 270-m raster. The nodata values were then reverted back to zero, and the resulting raster was resampled to 30-m using cubic convolution , which does some interpolation among the 30-m cells within each 270-m cell. A 30-m processing mask was used after the resampling so that the BP was set to nodata for open water and snow/ice land covers (based on the LANDFIRE FBFM40 dataset) and any BP values less than zero produced in the cubic convolution set back to zero.\n",

This was accomplished by identifying contiguous patches of burnable fuel using the ArcGIS Region Group tool on the 30-m, burnable fuel grid (LANDFIRE FBFM40). After isolating the small islands of burnable fuel surrounded by nonburnable, the nonzero BP values within the islands were temporarily set to NoData to prevent burn probability from being spread well into nonburnable areas from these small islands.\n",

This process used the following multi-stage approach. First we resampled CRPS from 270-m to 30-m by running two low-pass filters at 270-m, then we stamped original values back on top to preserve the spatial patterns in the 270-m data. Next, we used two iterative 150-m moving window means on the 30-m CRPS to create the primary smoothed CRPS raster, and we also created an alternate version of smoothed CRPS using three iterative 510-m moving window means.

This was done by setting zero-BP cells to nodata, then running two low-pass filters over the 270-m raster.

This process used the following multi-stage approach. First we resampled CRPS from 270-m to 30-m by running two low-pass filters at 270-m, then we stamped original values back on top to preserve the spatial patterns in the 270-m data. Next, we used two iterative 150-m moving window means on the 30-m CRPS to create the primary smoothed CRPS raster, and we also created an alternate version of smoothed CRPS using three iterative 510-m moving window means. The final 30-m CRPS raster was generated by using the cell values produced with the tighter window where they exist (up to 300-m into nonburnable fuels) and the alternate version everywhere else with non-zero BP (between 300-m and 1530-m into non-burnable fuels).

It is part of the Wildfire Risk to Communities: Spatial datasets of landscape-wide wildfire risk components for the United States. The values of FLEP4 represent the probability of having flame lengths greater than 4 feet if a fire occurs. FLEP4 indicates the potential for moderate to high wildfire intensity. Because 4 feet is considered the limit of manual fire control, FLEP4 represents the likelihood that fire intensity will be beyond the ability of hand crews to control.\n",

National wildfire hazard datasets of annual burn probability and fire intensity were generated from the LANDFIRE 2014 data by the USDA Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station (Short et al. 2020) using the large fire simulation system (FSim). These national datasets produced with FSim have a relatively coarse cell size of 270 meters (m). To bring these datasets down to a finer resolution more useful for assessing hazard and risk to communities, we upsampled them to the native 30 m resolution of the LANDFIRE fuel and vegetation data. In this upsampling process, we also spread values of modeled burn probability and intensity into developed areas represented in LANDFIRE fuels data as non-burnable.
